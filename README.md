## What and why?
Tasklatte - a wellness and productivity app that aims to promote organization in one's academic and personal lives through the visualization of a coffee shop! It encourages a balanced schedule that opposes poor time management and burnout from unsustainable study habits and the lack of breaks. 

Though there exist numerous resources such as calendars and to-do lists, Tasklatte is a personalized, adaptive scheduling system that evolves and adjusts according to a user's habits, productivity, and energy. Unlike a static list or visualization, a Tasklatte calendar shifts with the assistance of AI and smart scheduling algorithms to suggest users a customized study and wellness plan. It also provides a visual representation through a cafe to give a visualization of how heavy your schedule truly is! Thus, it allows users to have a more holistic look at their schedule in integrating academics with personal wellness. 

## For whom?
Tasklatte is for those who question how to balance the mass compilation of assignments, exams, work, and fun –– in other words, _university students_. 

More specifically, if you're currently: 
- Taking multiple classes
- Prone to procrastination, burnout, or cramming
- Wanting to build healthier habits and integrate personal breaks in ones schedule 
- Already using organizational tools like Google Calendar or Notion, yet want something more personalized  

Students, this is the space for you to find healthier academic and lifestyle choices for your schedule.

## How?

From an end-user's perspective:
- Initially the user will input their class schedule, recurring events, and upcoming assignments, exams, and projects. They should also input estimated completion times and due dates. 
- From there, the smart scheduling algorithm will generate a studying schedule to make all tasks, small or large, manageable. It will also suggest wellness breaks and times for rest.
- Over time as the user interacts with the app and inputs the actual time of completion and the dates of when the assignments were completed, the schedule will learn what the user's productivity patterns are. For example, it will learn when they focus the best and how long each assignment takes, specific to each subject. This allows the schedule to adapt based on previous weeks but still be easily adjusted based on spontaneous events or even during exam weeks. 
- Users will be able to receive "daily blends" of their activites and the reminders and progress tracking to be motivated. 
- The visual aspect of the cafe will help to embody the workload of the student so there is further customization. 

## Scope
This proposal provides a challenge but is also realistic to build. 

It will involve delivering an app that is responsive for scheduling, time tracking, and task storage. It will also require curating an algorithm that will generate schedules based on scientifically proven study methods and a basic AI/machine learning model that adapts to users' behaviors. It will also involve the creation of an interface / visualization (in the form of a coffee shop) that updates according to the workload of the user each day.
