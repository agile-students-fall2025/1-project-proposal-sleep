## What and why?
Tasklatte - a wellness and productivity app that aims to promotes organization in one's academic and personal lives through the visualization of a coffeshop! It encourages a balanced schedule that opposes poor time management and burnout from unsustainable study habits and the lack of breaks. 

Though there exists numerous resources such as calendars and to-do lists, Tasklatte is a personalized, adaptive scheduling system that evolves and adjusts according to a user's habits, productivity, and energy. Instead of a static list or visualization, a Tasklatte calendar shifts with the assistance of AI and smart scheduling algorithms to suggest users with a customized study and wellness plan. It also provides a visual representation through a cafe to give a visualization of how heavy your schedule truly is! Thus, allowing users to have a more holistic look at their schedule in integrating academics with personal wellness. 

## For whom?
Tasklatte is for those who question how to balance the mass compilation of assignments, exams, work, and fun! In other words, _university students_. 

More specifically, if you're currently: 
- Taking multiple classes
- Prone to procrastination, burnout, or cramming
- Want to build healthier habits and integrate personal breaks in ones schedule 

This is a space that learns your schedule and suggests healthier alternatives so you can feel better and 

## How?
A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

## Scope
A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.
